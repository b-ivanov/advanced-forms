# Advanced forms

## Description
Advanced forms is single page application developed using Vue 3 and additional modules (see list below). It has a Home page from which the user can log in or register. After logging in the user is navigated to the activation wizard to fill in his data devided in 6 forms (see list below). Each form is rendered dynamically from a configuration object stored in the ui_structures folder. It describes sections with fields, their types, validation rules and their layout. Also, the form object may contain urls for data transmission, as well as action buttons for executing different commands. The application is developed in a way to support localization, validation and automatic submition and retrieval of data (details below).

## Build
To build and run the application clone this git repository, install the needed modules and run the development server. This is done with a few commands:
```
cd advanced-forms
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Validation
Validation is handled by the VeeValidate module. The application uses its Form, Field and ErrorMessage components to render errors before submit of the form. Validation rules for each field are stored in the form object.

## Localization
Localization is handled by the i18n module. Each label in the application has a uniqueID wich is later used to take the translation of the text from the corresponding language json in the locales folder.

## Form data transmission
The FormContainer component has build in functions for submitting and retriveing (static and user) data.
